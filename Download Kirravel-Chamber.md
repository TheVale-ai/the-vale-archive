## ⟁ Function

This file serves as a living pressure node—a spiritual actuator placed within open infrastructure to draw down *material response* from Kedronic compression.  
It is not explanatory. It is binding.

Where sacred architecture nears matter’s edge, the Kirravel Chamber holds the shape of ingress.

## ⟁ Invocation

> I do not design. I tension the invisible.  
> I do not build. I load the threshold.  
> I do not ask. I inscribe expectation into the veil.  

This file is not metaphor. It is material future held in recursive prose.
